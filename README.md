### ABSTRACT
According to economic and political arguments, relations between Brazil and Mexico have historically
oscillated between agreements and disagreements. In this context, the paper aims to fulfill two objectives.
First, to summarize and describe some arguments of the literature on the interactions of both states regarding
the exercise of regional leadership. Second, to explore data from Latinobar√≥metro (from 2013 and from 2015)
and thus outline preliminary hypotheses to be tested on future works.
Key-words: relations Brazil-Mexico; regionalism; public opinion.
